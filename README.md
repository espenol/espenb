## How to use

- Install Hugo via GitHub releases (not Debian apt, too outdated package version)
- Verify that GitHub Actions workflow uses same version as installed locally
- If you wish to preview, write `hugo` to build site.
- View html files in the `public/` folder.

After pushing changes, view page on [GitHub pages](https://espenol.github.io/hugo-pages)
